      <description>This weeks update is going to be pretty short as I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much on the project. I worked to update the chunk rendering system to render chunks instead of individual tiles. I also started caching the vertices of chunks so that if a chunk has previously been displayed, the vertices don&amp;rsquo;t need to be recalculated every frame. I also made it so that updates to window size are reflected, however this still needs to be moved to a translation matrix instead of recalculating vertices based on window size.</description>
