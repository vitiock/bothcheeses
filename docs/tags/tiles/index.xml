      <description>This week I worked on making it so that given a set of terrain, the tiles would line up and have smooth transitions between them, instead of just being squares with hard edges. This was a lot of work because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for how many different tile variations there were between just two types of terrain. To understand how to render an individual piece of terrain we need to look at all 8 surrounding neighbors.</description>
