      <description>This week I worked on making it so that given a set of terrain, the tiles would line up and have smooth transitions between them, instead of just being squares with hard edges. This was a lot of work because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for how many different tile variations there were between just two types of terrain. To understand how to render an individual piece of terrain we need to look at all 8 surrounding neighbors.</description>

      <description>This is the first post of what will be a dev log to document my process of making a game. I&amp;rsquo;m mainly using this as a mechanism to hold myself accountable and insure that I am making progress towards goals. This is likely to look an awful lot like a sprint retrospective in the start as I learn what makes a good post and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
I will also likely use this space at times to talk about general computer science related topics and the experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had as a developer.</description>
