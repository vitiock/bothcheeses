      <description>This is the first post of what will be a dev log to document my process of making a game. I&amp;rsquo;m mainly using this as a mechanism to hold myself accountable and insure that I am making progress towards goals. This is likely to look an awful lot like a sprint retrospective in the start as I learn what makes a good post and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
I will also likely use this space at times to talk about general computer science related topics and the experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had as a developer.</description>
